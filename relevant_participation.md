Making interactive media environments relevant to the participating visitor

Roles and expectations
-

In the context of the theatre, there are strict roles for all involved that make the event happen. Usually the space is designed in a way that enforces these roles to be performed (the audience or spectators sits in seats facing a stage, upon which the actors are performing). This context is so strong that even when we are outside of the theatre, we tend to follow these roles, as soon as we get the impression of a performance being given, for example when someone in some sort of costume starts to act out of the ordinary in a public space - a crowd will gather and create a circle around the actor[^1] and assume the role of spectator. Similarly, in a gallery or exhibition context we assume that we have to be quietly observing the art work, which we normally are not allowed to touch.


Within the world of the work that is performed the actors[^1] have roles that have meaning within that world - they are the agressors and the victims in the world, the story that is told unfolds because of their actions. The spectators are outside of this world, they do not exist and thus have no role in it; they can empathize with the actors in the the story and in that way emotionally engage in the story.


As a spectator comes to see a work, she takes along the role that she has in society and depending on her company going to the event, she will have different social roles (a friend among good friends, a colleague amongst peers on a business trip, a romantic date with a loved one). The social role that she brings along will have an influence on how free she will feel to express herself.


If we want the audience to become an active participant in our work, we need to:

- enable to break away from the traditional role of spectator
- enable to break out of the social roles
- give the participant a role within the world of the work
- care about the first person perspective of this role - what is the story the participant will experience



Interaction and improvisation
-

In interactive media environments, the interaction will happen on several levels, and these need to work together to make the experience whole. To start thinking about this, it is important to first have an idea of what the role of the participant will be, and what the experience is that the creators want to enable for the participant. After this general idea, the interaction can be broken down to further steps on the different levels:

*The interaction between participants and the technology*

- How can sensors be used to sense actions and/or gestures of the participants?
- How can the data of these sensors be used to shape events in the media within the environment (such as sound, light, video, mechatronics)?
- How do we expect the media events to change the behaviour of the participants?

*The interaction between the participants and actors*

- How can the actors engage participants into the story?
- How should the actors react to actions the participants initiate?

*The interaction between the actors and the technology*

Besides the points raised above on interaction between the participants and the technology, the actors can take on an additional role in guiding the participants into how to engage with the technology, or guide them away from it in case their engagement with the technology becomes too much focused on testing the system, rather than enriching the experience.

*The interaction with the dramaturgical structure*

This is perhaps the hardest one to tackle - how can the actions of the participants influence the unfolding of events within the story during the performance?

- Is there a structure with scenes within which actions can be taken, but they do not change the sequence of scenes that will follow?
- Is the structure open to have different directions of scenes: i.e. decisions participants make have a consequence for the scenes that follow?
- Is the structure completely open and are scenes created as they unfold?
- Is the structure open to differences in time (are scenes strictly connected to time frames, or can a scene have a longer or shorter duration depending on what happens)?

Leaving the dramaturgy more open to change, may make the total experience less strong, as it is harder to predict the unfolding of events. On the other hand, enforcing a strong dramaturgical structure may leave the participant feel out of control and she may loose engagement.




*Improvisation*

In all of these levels, improvisation plays an important role. In order to have interaction between the different elements have a meaning (otherwise a classical cue-based system would suffice), there needs to be space for improvisation.

What is the space for improvisation within the dramaturgy, what are the rules for improvisation for the actors, and what are the possibilities for improvisation of the participants.

Perhaps another layer of improvisation is for the media itself: in how far can the designers of the media[^2] during the event improvise and change the behaviour of the media.


Invitation and engagement
-

With new musical instruments (that make use of various sensors), there is an approach where in the first minutes of the performance you make clear how the instrument works - you make the interaction of the performer with the instrument clear, so that the spectator can understand the relationship between what the performer does and what happens with the sound.

To invite audience in as participants, the first thing to do is to invite them to shed their role as spectator and become a participant. Then the next step is to explain the modes of interaction - show them what they can do in the environment and what happens based on what they do in the environment. This first explanation should be clear enough to invite them to explore the possibilities more - that means that even after the first explanation is made, there needs to be enough that can still be discovered so that the experience stays engaging. Once you understand you can push a button to cause something to happen, after ten times pushing the same button and have the same reaction, it becomes boring and uninteresting.


Methods and ideas
-

For the spectator to become a participant, the first step is to get the spectator to accept the invitation to become a participant and leave behind their normal zone.

*No luggage*

A visitor to a theatre or exhibition usually brings along a coat and a bag, and in these days their gadgets (phones). A first step can be to let them leave these behind in a secure space: give the opportunity to leave their belongings in a locker or another safe place, so they do not have to worry about their coat, their bag and their phone, and are more free to move around.

*Costume*

A next step may be to change their costume, this can be anything between a simple thing like taking of their shoes, to having them actually change into a costume that fits to the role that they are in. The costume will suggest modes of movement to them, and possibly give them a feeling of safety to move and act freely.

*Object*

Instead of an object, you can give the visitor an object that they can hold, that will have some importance in the environment.

*Split up*

Split groups of friends up in some way, so that every individual feels free to behave without the limitations of their social role within their group.

*A role*

In the description or introduction of the work, do not only mention the world that the visitor is about to enter, but also ascribe a role for the visitor. Rather than "you can interact with the world", describe who they are within the world. Give them a context from which they can start their imagination.

*A choice*

Give them a choice at the beginning, that gives them a sense of control or agency within the environment.

*A task*

Give them a small task to perform, e.g. to search for something.

*Guidance*

Guide the visitors (individually or in a group) into the environment by giving them instructions on what to do (movement instructions) or what their role is (narrative construction) or what they should pay attention to (awareness), leave more and more space for their own interpretations, so they are slowly guided into acting on their own.

*Workshop*

Give a short workshop at the beginning, which will explain the rules and modes of interaction within the environment (verbally, or in combination with movement exercises).
